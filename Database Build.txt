Build a MySQL-Backed Streamlit Application for Transport Cost Evaluation
Objective:
Create a complete workflow that builds a MySQL database named Transport_database, imports data from the provided Excel (Book 3.xlsx) or its converted formats (Book_3_converted.csv, Book_3_converted.json), and integrates this database into a Streamlit application. The application should support transport cost calculations and data retrieval based on parameters defined in the Excel file Mappe2 1 1.xlsx.

Input Files:
Data Source:
Book 3.xlsx (or its CSV/JSON equivalents) — contains the raw transport-related data.
Workflow Definition:
Mappe2 1 1.xlsx — contains the logic, formulas, and parameters for transport cost evaluation.

Step 1: Database Setup
Database Name: Transport_database
Technology: MySQL (already installed and running)
Tasks:
Analyze the structure of Book 3.xlsx and define appropriate tables and schema.
Create SQL scripts to:
Create the database and tables.
Insert all data from the chosen format (CSV/JSON/Excel).
Ensure data types and relationships are preserved.

Step 2: Logic Integration from Mappe2 1 1.xlsx
Extract the calculation logic and parameter definitions from the Excel file.
Implement the following steps in the application:
Step 1: Weight and quantity calculations
Step 2: Route and delivery parameters
Step 3: Cost evaluation based on carrier pricing and delivery metrics
Use the Excel sheet as a reference for:
Default values
Lookup tables (e.g., packaging types, country codes)
Conditional logic (e.g., full truck load pricing)

Step 3: Streamlit Application
Frontend Features:
Input fields for user-defined parameters (e.g., material weight, packaging type, delivery frequency)
Dropdowns or selectors populated from the database
Buttons to trigger calculations
Backend Integration:
Connect to the MySQL database
Perform calculations using the logic from Mappe2 1 1.xlsx
Display results in a user-friendly format (tables, charts, summaries)
Output:
Transport cost per delivery
Price per loading unit (LU)
Lead time and route details

Step 4: Workflow Automation
Allow users to:
Modify parameters dynamically
Save and retrieve calculation scenarios
Export results (CSV, PDF)

Notes:
Default receiver location is Aldersbach, DE 94501
Stackability factor, loading meters, and other derived metrics must be calculated as per the Excel logic
Ensure international vs. national pricing logic is respected
Include error handling for missing or inconsistent data
